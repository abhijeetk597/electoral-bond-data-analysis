# Analysis of Electoral Bond Data

As mandated by the Honorable Supreme Court of India, the State Bank of India (SBI) has submitted comprehensive data on Electoral Bonds to the Election Commission of India, spanning from April 12, 2019, to January 24, 2024. This data, now publicly available on the ECI website, holds critical insights into political financing in India.

📊 In this analysis, I've uncovered some fascinating findings:

- Out of 18,871 purchased bonds, 130 worth 9.63 Cr have expired.
- The top 5 purchasers accounted for approximately 26% of the total bond denomination, with the top 10 purchasers representing around 34%.
- FUTURE GAMING AND HOTEL SERVICES stands out, purchasing a remarkable 11.25% of bonds worth 1368 Cr.
- BHARATIYA JANATA PARTY leads in donations received through electoral bonds, totaling 6060.5 Cr, approximately 47% of the total.
- BJP is followed by TMC and INC who received 1609 Cr (12.60%) and 1422 Cr (11.13%) respectively.

🔎 But that's not all! I believe more insights can be generated if Purchasing Entities can be classified into different categories.
